        <code>Home is the place where we return to rest after a day’s work,</code> and <code>parents and children meet together and have a carefree and joyful time. Our family consists of three members—father, mother, and brother. We live in a rural area. It is free from the hustle and bustle of city life. It is especially famous for its scenic beauty.</code> <code>My Father is the most important member of the family. Everyone trusts my judgement and agrees to follow my suggestions.</code>
